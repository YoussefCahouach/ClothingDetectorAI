# ClothingDetectorAI


<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This project involves the development of an AI system in Python, using clustering algorithms such as k-means and KNN for the detection of clothing items based on both shape and color. By leveraging the power of these algorithms, this AI system is able to accurately identify and categorize different types of clothing.

In addition to the AI system itself, a detailed [PDF document][Enllac] is available on the projectâ€™s GitHub page. This document explains the functionality of each part of the program, as well as how to use it and the experiments that have been conducted. By providing this information, users can gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the AI system and how it can be used to its full potential.
